# RubberDuckyEncoderStarter
It's everything you need to start encoding your USBRubberDucky Payloads ... Quack!!  :) :)

I recently got my USB Rubber Ducky and I was really interested in the command line java encoder.
RubberDuckyEncoderStarter.py is everything you need to start encoding your USB Rubber Ducky Payloads. It makes using the command line Java Encoder by HAK5.org super easy.
It works on both Python2 and Python3.
It's also tested on Windows, Linux and macOS.

How to use it:

1- Place the .py file in the same directory with your Payloads.
2- Open cmd (for Windows) or Terminal (for Linux or macOS) and navigate to your Payloads directory.
3- type python RubberDuckyEncoderStarter.py then press Enter (or Return :):) ).
5- Enjoy !!

The script will automatically download the encoder.jar from :https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/blob/master/Encoder/encoder.jar
Just make sure you have Java installed on your machine.

Quack,Quack !!
:) :)
